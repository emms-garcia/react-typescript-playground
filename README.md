# react-typescript-playground

Playing with [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html) / [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) / [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) / [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

# Development Setup

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to run the local development server.
3. Profit.

Notes:
* You can run `npm run lint` to run the linter and check for any errors/warnings.
* Additionally you can run `npm run format` so it automatically fixes them for you whenever possible.

# Storybooks

To run the Storybook with the isolated components, run `npm run storybook`.
